v1 of the interaction viewer is deployed in EBI's Complex Portal, e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/complex/details/EBI-706830

We are working towards a general purpose web component for visualising interactions between biomolecules.
The aim is to represent the data present in the PSI-MI standards.

## Input data

The 'MI-JSON' data format consumed by the interaction-viewer is generated by the JAMI framework.
See: https://github.com/MICommunity/psimi

JAMI is capable of converting between various MI data formats, it can convert the PSI-MI XML standard into the MI-JSON format.

JAMI was originally developed by Marine Dumousseau, who also largely determined the structure of the MI-JSON format the viewer reads.

## Build Process

(0. install nodejs, npm)
1. Clone the repository.
2. $ cd /interaction-viewer
3. $ npm install
4. $ npm start

This starts a grunt task to watch the /src folder for changes. When a file changes (is saved), grunt will browserify the folder and save the compiled version in /build.

To build the minified version in /build, run:

1. $ grunt package
