Twelve copies of Lpd1 (also known as E3; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) are attached to the Lat1p core via the binding protein Pdx1. A variable number of Pda1 and Pdb1 (also known as E1 alpha and E1 beta, respectively) subunits bind as heterotetramers to the Lat1 core. \r\n\r\nIn the reaction mediated by the PDH complex, pyruvate becomes covalently linked to the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor of E1 (Pda1 and Pdb1), creating 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP. The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (Lat1). Lat1 transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA."
